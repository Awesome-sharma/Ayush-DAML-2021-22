The project is based on that how many accidents happen in India in 2018.

The data set we have worked upon has been downloaded from data.gov.in. It’s an census dataset 
of year 2018 of the country India. Firstly we analyzed the data set by simply opening the “csv” 
file. Then we pre-processed the wholedata set to remove the insignificant columns and empty 
rows. Also, to get to know the all unique value of each attributes.

Further, we performed the data visualization on the data set. We performed Exploratory analysis 
of each to get an idea about how the values are entered in each attributes withreference to no. of 
entries. 

We performed total of four modules of Python on our dataset: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
The support of an objective is to clean data and provide the maximum solutions of the queries 
generated from this dataset using above Modules and to visualize them for better understanding.
